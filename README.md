## TasksConverter
This is a simple .txt to .json converter that will take in a list of tasks in the text file and convert them into a json file (with the task and Bible verse)

## Purpose
This is a tool to help generate my lists of tasks for the FaithTasks repo.

# Example Usage
When the command line argument `2023-01-01` is used, each task in the history dictionary will start at that day (and then incrementing by one).
